# -----------------
# This file lists domains where some, but not all, MX hosts have TLSA lookup
# failures, or publish TLSA records but don't offer STARTTLS or present a
# non-matching certificate chain.  At least one MX host has working DANE and so
# it is not appropriate to include the domain in the main list, but email
# delivery to the domain is potentially degraded, and further failures may lead
# to a complete outage.
#
# DANE support should not be disabled for these domains, but they are on a
# "watch list" for further problems, and it should not surprising to find
# transient DANE-related delivery issues to these domains in MTA logs.
